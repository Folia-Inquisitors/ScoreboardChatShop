#Syntax:
# %scoreboardchatshop_price% - Price of specific request (only functions where applicable)
# %scoreboardchatshop_amount% - Amount of specific arequest (only functions where applicable)
# %scoreboardchatshop_material% - Material specified (only functions where applicable)
# %scoreboardchatshop_basebundleprice% - Price of base bundle (only functions where applicable)
# %scoreboardchatshop_basebundleamount% - Amount of base bundle (only functions where applicable)
# %scoreboardchatshop_basematerial% - Official material name
#Coloring:
# - Standard color codes apply
# - "&?" substitutes as a random vanilla color
# - "&??" substitutes as a random hex color
# - "&>RGB######___&<RGB######" will become an RGB gradient spanning from the left hex code color to the right hex code color
#     ###### represents hex codes
#     ___ represents the text (typically a placeholder) which the gradient spans across
# - "&>LCH######___&<LCH######" will become an LCH gradient spanning from the left hex code color to the right hex code color
#     LCH traverses nicer across colors than RGB in my opinion. If you don't know the difference, not a big deal just try both.
#     ###### represents hex codes
#     ___ represents the text (typically a placeholder) which the gradient spans across
